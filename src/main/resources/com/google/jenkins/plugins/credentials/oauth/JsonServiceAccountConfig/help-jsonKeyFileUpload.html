  <p>
    This is the "{project name}-xxxxxxxxxxxx.json" file associated with the service account credential in
    the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Developer Console</a>. A new private key may be generated
    for a service account if you no longer have the original.

  <p>
    To create a new service account:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Select your project from the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/project">Project list</a>.</li>
    <li>Navigate to "APIs & Auth" and then "Credentials"</li>
    <li>Click the "Create new Client ID" button</li>
    <li>Select "Service account" and click "Create Client ID".</li>
    <li>A dialog should pop-up to download the private key file for the new service account, save this in a secure
      location. <b>This is the file you must upload here.</b></li>
    <li>After clicking, "Okay, got it", you should see a "Service Account" section; in order to generate a new
      Private key, click on the "Generate new JSON key" button just underneath it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To regenerate the client secrets file for an existing service account, follow the above instructions until the
    "Create new Client ID" step and instead find the Service Account for which you need a new key and click
    "Generate new JSON key".</p>
