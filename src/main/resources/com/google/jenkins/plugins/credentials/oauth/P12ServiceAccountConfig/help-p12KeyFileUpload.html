    This is the "{project name}-xxxxxxxxxxxx.p12" file associated with the service account credential in
    the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Developer Console</a>. A new private key may be generated
    for a service account if you no longer have the original.

  <p>
    To create a new service account:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Select your project from the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/project">Project list</a>.</li>
    <li>Navigate to "APIs & Auth" and then "Credentials"</li>
    <li>Click the "Create new Client ID" button</li>
    <li>Select "Service account" and click "Create Client ID".</li>
    <li>A dialog should pop-up to download the private key file for the new service account, save this in a secure
      location. This file contains a Private key in json format. <b>This is NOT the file you must upload here.</b></li>
    <li>After clicking, "Okay, got it", you should see a "Service Account" section; click on the "Generate new P12 key"
      button just underneath it. <b>This is the file you must upload here.</b></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To generate a new key for an existing service account, follow the above instructions until the "Create new Client
    ID" step and instead find the Service Account for which you need a new key and click "Generate new P12 key".</p>
